<p>We present sketch-rnn a recurrent neural network RNN able to construct stroke-based drawings of common objects. We outline a framework for conditional and unconditional sketch. Specically we feed the sketch sequence S and also the same sketch. The model is trained on thousands of crude human-drawn images representing hundreds of classes.
