<p><strong>Sketch Too Slow Drawing</strong>, My Sketchup is acting very slow too purge doesnt seem to work but I was able to copy and paste my model into a new file resave and now the file is 10 the size of the original and runs much faster. I just ran into a similar problem like that with multiple windows slowing my machine way down because my graphics card has poor driver support for Windows 7. The computer CPU works at less than 30.</p>
