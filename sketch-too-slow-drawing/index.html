<p><strong>Sketch Too Slow Drawing</strong>, My Sketchup is acting very slow too purge doesnt seem to work but I was able to copy and paste my model into a new file resave and now the file is 10 the size of the original and runs much faster. I just ran into a similar problem like that with multiple windows slowing my machine way down because my graphics card has poor driver support for Windows 7. The computer CPU works at less than 30.</p>

<p>The computer is a new 2 month old Dell. Hi there First of all I am an IT person who is trying to help a SketchUp user who is not familiar with computers and Ive been asked to try and resolve the problem. I just ran into a similar problem like that with multiple windows slowing my machine way down because my graphics card has poor driver support for Windows 7. My Sketchup is acting very slow too purge doesnt seem to work but I was able to copy and paste my model into a new file resave and now the file is 10 the size of the original and runs much faster. Your machine may be too slow to handle the image as well. I Felt Better About Things Yesterday But I Was Too Slow And Got Sidetracked I Did Pick Up Some New Markers Though These Are Almost Sketch Book Pick Up D I D.</p>
