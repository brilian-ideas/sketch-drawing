<p><strong>Creo Sketcher To Drawing</strong>, If you are using the default template to create the drawing of a part that has simplified representations the default representation is used to create the drawing. The new drawing is created with the selected representation set as the current representation of the drawing model. The most of simple way of showing dimensions in drawing is to add Geometry points in model sketch and then add dimensions by measuring these points in drawing.</p>
