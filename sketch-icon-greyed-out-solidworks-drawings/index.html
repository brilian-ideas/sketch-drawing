<p>I cannot seem to figure out why the insert Sketch Picture on SW2012 SP4 64bit installation will not work. The trouble is Sketch Picture is greyed out in my version of Solidworks. Tool bars greyed out in drawing. The icon is greyed out. I have an assembly and drawing that I have been working on for a couple days.
