<p>With fourier analysis we can break a signal up into simple periodic signals. I had quite a bit fun creating this so at the end there is a brief explanation trying to give the reader some mathematical intuition as to how revolving circles and the fourier transform. The best explanation by far is this video by 3Blue1BrownBut recently I saw a video by SmarterEveryDay showing a visual demonstration of the fourier series using circles so I tried this for myself. This website allows you to draw your own fourier epicycle drawings either by uploading an svg or by mouse. Drawing with the fourier series. Fourier Series Introduction Video Khan Academy.</p>
